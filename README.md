# myJsProject

My FSJS project is called the TrailTracker app.  It was designed to let users keep track of every trail they hike. It consists of a form with multiple catagories, allowing the user to keep a detailed list of every hike they attempt throughout the year.  The user should be able to add, edit, and delete trails when required.  

To run the trail tracker app, follow these directions:

1. Download from github.
2. Go to the root directory.
3. Run npm install to install packages.
4. Open another terminal tab and enter 'mongod' to begin the mongo database.
5. In the other terminal enter "npm start".
6. Finally, open your perferred web browser and travel to "localhost:7777".
